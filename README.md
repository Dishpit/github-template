# Github Template

Github Template is an example layout of what I believe to be a good github repository structure. As always, your personal use-case and your mileage may vary - what works for me doesn't always work for everybody else, so please fine-tune it to fit your needs. This is meant to be used as an example.

All of the data provided (such as dependencies and requirements) are for the sake of example, and are not meant to be actual guidelines or specifications. Again, tailor it to fit your needs.

## Supported Platforms
